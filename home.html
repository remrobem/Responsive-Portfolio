        <p>Rob Martin is an IT professional with 35 years of experience. Rob grew up as a developer in the IBM mainframe world,
            moved on to being an SAP developer, fell into web application vulnerability scanning and has plowed thru SAP
            security, governance, risk management and compliance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Not one to shy away from change, Rob is now pursing challenges in web application development. Front-end, back-end,
            UI design, testing, anything is possible at this point.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Please don't hold this against him, but Rob has spent most of his career in a Fortune 250 company. Twenty six years
            of multi-million dollar projects, you're on your own projects, managing development and support teams, coding,
            testing, fixing, you name it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Rob doesn't care much about moving up the management ladder, preferring to hone his creative and debugging skills
            in whatever platform is needed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Rob and his wife Teresa have been married for 36 years. They raised 3 great sons, have a wonderful daughter-in-law
            and a fantastic grandson. And they have a cat they would rather not talk about.
